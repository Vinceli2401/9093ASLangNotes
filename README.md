**Mostly present tense, sense of immediacy, past is also alright**

Can be **conversational, informality**.

Again, tone must be **positive, negative or mixed**

## Directed Response and Comparative Analysis

Essentially a writing task

**Form, tone, purpose, audience, viewpoint**

***150-200 words is not a recommendation, is compulsory!!! you cannot go over it!*** 

Beginning: context, state purpose, my role



When you are doing the questions, **always annotate(5-6 language feature is fine) and analysis for structure, form and language.** Ergo, start from question b and backtrack to question a.



### Structring a comparative response

Typically 400 - 600 words

Structure: overview(PATT), characteristic, structure , and language 

# Common Mistakes
There is no plural form of imagery ("imageries" is wrong)

People tend to overlook **expanded noun phrases**
